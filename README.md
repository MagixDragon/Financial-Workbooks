# Financial-Workbooks

This is a Microsoft Excel 2013 Workbook that does a simplified form of the marginal tax rate calculations and graphing presented by Safeguard Wealth Management as part of the Holistiplan financial advisor software.

In it's current form it only has the tax rates for 2024 and filing statuses Single and Married Joint.

I am new to Github, but I think you can post bug reports and feature requests through the plaform.
